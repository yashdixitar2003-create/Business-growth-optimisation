Business Growth Optimisation
Customer Churn Prediction Model
📌 Project Overview

Customer churn is a major barrier to sustainable business growth. This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques and transforming those predictions into actionable business insights that support retention strategies, revenue optimisation, and long-term growth.

The model identifies customers at high risk of leaving and helps stakeholders take proactive measures to improve customer lifetime value (CLV).
